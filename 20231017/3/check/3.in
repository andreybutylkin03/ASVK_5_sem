approach has been tested on data from computing clusters of the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and 
Cybernetics, Lomonosov Moscow State University and NIKIET JSC [13].
However, this solution is also not suitable because it does not allow to analyze and prediction. There are 
other systems [14] for analyzing the efficiency of using a cluster. Nevertheless, trying to connect such 
systems to the SLURM wastes large amount of resources, while our proposed method only requires the 
development of a component where analysis system can easily get embedded. In another work [15], various 
metrics for clusters are studied, where the user will have to use these metrics manually to predict the run 
time of the job which is not a ready-made solution.
3.2 Statement of technical specifications
The task is done through design, develop and test the functionality of the component (or components) 
connected to the SLURM queuing system. The component collects statistical data and does analysis on the flow 
of computational tasks. The component is a system of two modules implemented as:
 Add-ons to SLURM to add and handle the --predict-time option in the srun and sbatch commands to predict the 
job run time.
 A Linux daemon that handles HTTP requests, trains the model, and etc. (hereinafter - the main application). 
The application must be able to connect custom algorithms according to a given template.
In addition, special scripts are required to install these modules easily.
4. Conclusion and future work
Our work has led us to conclude that adding new features to the dataset improves prediction accuracy. An 
innovative solution for the resource allocation problem was found. The possibility of writing a plugin to 
apply our machine learning system in practical applications was studied. It was found that designing a plugin 
allows the practical use of machine learning algorithms in decision making. However, it is required to 
improve the performance of this component. In future work, we will use this component to evaluate our 
algorithms on a real cluster to find the best method to do prediction.
