Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that in High-Performance Computing HPC users’ resource estimations lack accuracy.
Therefore, resource underestimation may remove the job at any step of computing and subsequently allocated resources will be wasted. Moreover, resource overestimation also will waste 
resources. In this work, to effectively utilize the overall HPC system, we proposed a new approach to predict the required resources such as; number of required CPUs, time slots etc. for newly submitted job. 
The study focused on predictive analytics tasks including regression and classification. A supervised machine learning system, comprising several models, was trained based on 
the collection of statistical data including per-job and per-user features collected from the reference queue systems. Results indicated that adding more features to the dataset improves the prediction accuracy. The possibility of designing a plugin to apply our machine learning system in practical applications was studied. A dynamically connected SLURM SPANK plugin was created that adds the “--predict-time”
option and takes control on srun and sbatch commands while they are executed. It was found that the plugin enables practical use of our proposed machine learning system.
