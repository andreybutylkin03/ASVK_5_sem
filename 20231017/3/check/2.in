To make our system applicable on the SLURM we need to create a plugin. Therefore, 
a component was designed to connect to the SLURM. It has the ability to collect statistics, 
analyze them and based on the analysis create a model. Using this model, the prediction could be done. 
Plugins may not only complement, but also modify the behavior of SLURM to optimize the systemâ€™s performance. 
SLURM has a centralized SLURMctld manager for monitoring resources and tasks. Every compute server (node) 
has a SLURMd daemon that could be compared with a remote shell: it waits for a job, runs that job, returns 
state and waits for more work. In addition, SLURM has several utilities for its users. In this work we are 
mainly interested in 2 utilities: srun - to start a job and sbatch - for placing jobs in the queue. More 
precisely, sending a batchscript (instructions to SLURM to perform the job) to the SLURM.
3.1 Review of existing solutions
The standard SLURM package has a mechanism to predict only the starting time of a job. However, this 
mechanism is very primitive and more often the time is overestimated. Moreover, there is a software system 
for modeling the activity of computing cluster users based on the SLURM, which uses the collection of 
statistics to simulate the load on a model of computing cluster under the control of SLURM. This software 
lists several metrics used by the system administrators of clusters. This
